# XTL
XQUERY BASED MODEL TRANSFORMATION LANGUAGE

The XQuery-based tool provides a mechanism for automatically obtaining an XQuery library from a given meta-model. Meta-models are defined as XML schemas, and the XQuery library serves to query and create elements of an XML Schema. Additionally, the library serves to define transformations. Transformations are XQuery programs that use the library to map source models to target models.
